# Cyberbullying Classification

The widespread adoption of social media, with over 3.96 billion users globally by July 2020, has led to a troubling surge in cyberbullying incidents, posing severe emotional and psychological harm. Our study aims to address this by enhancing cyberbullying detection through the combining of datasets from Instagram and Twitter. Using CRISP-DM methodology, we used Natural Language Processing to preprocess our datasets and applied the following machine learning algorithms: SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression as well as ensemble methods (bagging). For Feature extraction, we utilised the Count vectorizer and TF-IDF techniques. The results of our study are as follows: for Twitter, Logistic Regression (LR) with count vectorizer showed the best results (precision 88%, F1, and recall 87%). Instagram's best model was LR with TF-IDF (precision, recall, and F1 at 81%). Upon combining datasets, SVM and LR with TF-IDF excelled on Twitter (precision 86%, F1 and recall 87%), while LR with count vectorizer performed well on Instagram (precision, recall, and F1 at 77%). Our study highlights the promising results achieved by combining datasets from various social media platforms, with comparable or improved performance compared to platform-specific data. Future research should focus on the growing need for cross-system user modelling to comprehensively understand cyberbullying in the interconnected world of multiple social media platforms. Additionally, they should consider expanding the range of social media platforms, employing advanced machine learning techniques, and proactively collecting new data to stay up-to-date with evolving online behaviours and language, ultimately enabling real-time prevention and intervention strategies.
